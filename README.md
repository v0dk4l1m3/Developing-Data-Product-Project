# Developing-Data-Product-Project
##### This application was created for Johns Hopkins University Developing Data Product Coursera class project.
##### It is a simple application that calculates carrier mobility and resistivity of various types of doped silicon (semiconductors used for building electronic devices).
##### The web version of the app can be accessed on https://v0dk4l1m3.shinyapps.io/DataProduct
##### The supporting framework for this app (server.R and ui.R) are included in this github repository.
##### The pitch slides are published on Rpubs and can be viewed on http://rpubs.com/v0dk4l1m3/111510
